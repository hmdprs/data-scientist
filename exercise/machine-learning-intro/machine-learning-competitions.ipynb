You can then improve your model (e.g. by adding features) to improve and see how you stack up to others taking this micro-course.\n\nThe steps in this notebook are:\n1. Build a Random Forest model with all of your data (**X** and **y**)\n2. Read in the \"test\" data, which doesn't include values for the target.  Predict home values in the test data with your Random Forest model.\n3. Submit those predictions to the competition and see your score.\n4. Optionally, come back to see if you can improve your model by adding features or changing your model. Then you can resubmit to see how that stacks up on the competition leaderboard."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Recap\nHere's the code you've written so far.

So open a new window by clicking on [this link](https://www.kaggle.com/c/home-data-for-ml-course).  Then click on the **Join Competition** button.\n\n![join competition image](https://i.imgur.com/wLmFtH3.png)\n\nNext, follow the instructions below:\n1. Begin by clicking on the blue **COMMIT** button in the top right corner of this window.  This will generate a pop-up window.  \n2. After your code has finished running, click on the blue **Open Version** button in the top right of the pop-up window.  This brings you into view mode of the same page. You will need to scroll down to get back to these instructions.\n3. Click on the **Output** tab on the left of the screen.  Then, click on the **Submit to Competition** button to submit your results to the leaderboard.\n\nYou have now successfully submitted to the competition!\n\n4. If you want to keep working to improve your performance, select the blue **Edit** button in the top right of the screen. Then you can change your model and repeat the process. There's a lot of room to improve your model, and you will climb up the leaderboard as you work.\n\n# Continuing Your Progress\nThere are many ways to improve your model, and **experimenting is a great way to learn at this point.**\n\nThe best way to improve your model is to add features.  Look at the list of columns and think about what might affect home prices.  Some features will cause errors because of issues like missing values or non-numeric data types. \n\nThe **[Intermediate Machine Learning](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/intermediate-machine-learning)** micro-course will teach you how to handle these types of features. You will also learn to use **xgboost**, a technique giving even better accuracy than Random Forest.\n\n\n# Other Micro-Courses\nThe **[Pandas](https://kaggle.com/Learn/Pandas)** micro-course will give you the data manipulation skills to quickly go from conceptual idea to implementation in your data science projects. \n\nYou are also ready for the **[Deep Learning](https://kaggle.com/Learn/Deep-Learning)** micro-course, where you will build models with better-than-human level performance at computer vision tasks."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"---\n**[Introduction to Machine Learning Home Page](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/intro-to-machine-learning)**\n\n\n\n\n\n*Have questions or comments?
